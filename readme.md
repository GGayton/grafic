This is a Rust library for handling graph structures.

Currently implemented:
 - Breadth-first iteration
 - Breadth-first iteration with early branch termination
 - Depth-first iteration
 - Recursive pruning -> iteratively remove nodes from a graph, neighbour-by-neighbour


Planned:
 - Constructor from a skeleton image
 - Path optimisation
 - To/from matrix representation
